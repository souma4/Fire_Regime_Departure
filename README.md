# Fire Regime Departure

Currently Version 1.0. All the code is stable.
Investigating fire regime departures across the american west as a part of a masters. Contains paper resources, scripts, and demos for EMD and our workflow in three wildernesses. If you have any questions about the code, consult the [wiki](https://github.com/souma4/Fire_Regime_Departure/wiki) or contact me. Please cite this repo (and paper when it comes out) if you use it.

## Current notable WIP items

- All objects pertaining to the paper are incomplete/inorganized. These will be updated in time.
- Demos need to be refined, cleaned up and made clearer.
