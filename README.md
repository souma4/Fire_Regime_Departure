# Fire Regime Departure
Investigating fire regime departures across the american west as a part of a masters. Contains figures scripts and a demo. Currently WIP. If you are here to look at figures, the figures repository is the place to go. Code is  WIP. I reserve all rights for this code. I am simply using Github right now for version control to ensure I always have multiple backups.
